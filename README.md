A3G mission template
====================
Basically it's a starting point for making a not-terrible mission.

How-To
======
- Go to the editor, open the map you want to make a mission on, hit save and give it a name.
- Download this repository, extract it to the mission folder, overwrite _everything_.
- Right click `mission.sqm`, click `Properties` and then uncheck `Read-only`, then hit apply. This step may not be necessary, but check anyways.
- Load or reload the mission in the editor.
- Start editing to your hearts content.

Important
=========
- The only files you need to edit are in the `config` folder and `stringTable.xml`, leave everything else alone.
- The github zip download on the right does NOT include the submodules, grab them from the actual projects instead ( click the name above in the folder view ) or use the releases download.
