A3G mission template
====================

Basically it's a starting point for making a not-terrible mission.

How-To
======
- Go to editor, open map you want to make a mission on, save and give it a name.
- Download zip, extract to mission folder, overwrite everything.
- Reload mission in editor.
- Only files you need to edit are in the `config` folder and `stringTable.xml`, leave everything else alone.
