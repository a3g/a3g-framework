A3G Framework
=============
Basically it's a starting point for making a not-terrible mission.

Usable right now?
-----------------
![Build status: Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/Build Status-Beta-yellow.svg)
Use at your own discretion.

How-To
======
- Go to the editor, open the map you want to make a mission on, hit save and give it a name.
- Download this repository, extract it to the mission folder, overwrite _everything_.
- Read the `Important` section below.
- Right click `mission.sqm`, click `Properties` and then uncheck `Read-only`, then hit apply. This step may not be necessary, but check anyways.
- Load or reload the mission in the editor.
- Start editing to whatever your heart desires.
- The only files you need to edit are in the `mission` folder and `stringTable.xml`, leave everything else alone.

Important
=========
- The github zip download on the right does _not_ include any modules, grab them from the [actual project](https://github.com/a3g/a3g-framework-modules) instead or use the [releases download](https://github.com/a3g/a3g-framework/releases). The latter method may not always be up-to-date.

Features
========
- Coming soon
